Note on current development
---------------------------

This project is currently in a beta phase.
The project setup, suggested workflows, definitions of particular tasks, and the signatures of various helper classes and functions are mostly frozen but could still be subject to changes in the near future.
At this point (December 2022), four large-scale analyses based upon columnflow are being developed, and in the process, help test and verify various aspects of its core.
The first released version is expected in early 2023.
However, if you would like to join early on, contribute or just give it a spin, feel free to get in touch!


Quickstart
----------

To create an analysis using columnflow, it is recommended to start from a predefined template (located in ).
The following command (no previous git clone required) interactively asks for a handful of names and settings, and creates a minimal, yet fully functioning project structure for you!

.. code-block:: bash

    bash -c "$(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uhh-cms/columnflow/master/create_analysis.sh)"

At the end of the setup, you will see further instructions and suggestions to run your first analysis tasks (example below).

.. code-block:: bash

    Setup successfull! The next steps are:

    1. Setup the repository and install the environment.
      > source setup.sh [optional_setup_name]

    2. Run local tests & linting checks to verify that the analysis is setup correctly.
      > ./tests/run_all

    3. Create a GRID proxy if you intend to run tasks that need one
      > voms-proxy-init -voms cms -rfc -valid 196:00

    4. Checkout the 'Getting started' guide to run your first tasks.
      https://columnflow.readthedocs.io/en/master/start.html

      Suggestions for tasks to run:

      a) Run the 'calibration -> selection -> reduction' pipeline for the first file of the
         default dataset using the default calibrator and default selector
         (enter the command below and 'tab-tab' to see all arguments or add --help for help)
        > law run cf.ReduceEvents --version dev1 --branch 0

      b) Create the jet1_pt distribution for the single top dataset:
        > law run cf.PlotVariables1D --version dev1 --datasets 'st*' --variables jet1_pt

      c) Include the ttbar dataset and also plot jet1_eta:
        > law run cf.PlotVariables1D --version dev1 --datasets 'tt*,st*' --variables jet1_pt,jet1_eta

      d) Create cms-style datacards for the example model in hgg/inference/example.py:
        > law run cf.CreateDatacards --version dev1 --inference-model example
